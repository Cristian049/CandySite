# 🍬 CandySite

**CandySite** is a small and simple web project created as part of my early learning journey. I built it specifically to practice and improve my CSS skills, focusing on layouts, styling, and basic visual effects. This is one of the first projects where I explored how CSS can shape the look and feel of a website.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project was to practice and experiment with CSS. Through this site, I worked on:

- Flexbox and Grid layouts
- Responsive design techniques
- Hover effects and transitions
- Theming and color combinations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for structuring the content
- **CSS3** – for styling and layout
- **JavaScript** – for minimal interactivity

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cristian049/CandySite.git

   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your browser:**

   You can open the file directly or use a local server (like Live Server in VS Code).

## 🙏 Final Notes

This was one of my early experiments in web development, made to explore how CSS works in practice. It's not complex, but it helped me understand visual design, layout structure, and how to write clean, simple CSS. I'm aware it can be improved, but it was a great learning experience.
